WeirdText encoding and decoding
*****************

WeirdText is a text encoding.

It is not "encryption" because humans can usually read it quite easily.  But machines may find it difficult to read without the list of original words.  Except of having fun, there are real-world applications for this, e.g. if encryption is forbidden by law in your country, but you still don't want your email content to get automatically processed somehow.
